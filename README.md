# Light Yield Tools 

A series of tools for generating light yield plots from photon library files in the DUNE far detectors.

## Getting Started

Setup necessary software with the following line:

```bash
. ./setup-plot.sh
```

To generate some example plots for the vertical drift far detector, run the following code:

```bash
root MakePlotVD.C
```

Note: Be sure to place a photon library root file in the working directory before running the code.
